#HR Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to monitor and analyze key workforce metrics such as employee presence, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and sick leave (SL). The dashboard provides insights across months, days of the week, and individual employees.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to enable HR teams to make data-driven decisions by identifying attendance patterns, understanding workforce efficiency, and supporting improvements in HR policies and employee management.
